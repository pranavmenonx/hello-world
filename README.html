  My name is Pranav Menon and I am currently a freshman at the University of Maryland @ College Park. I graduated high school from Robbinsville High School which is located in New Jersey. I consider myself a problem solver, possessing strong analytical skills and a flair for math, statistics, and computers. I am currently a Computer Science major and my goal is a career in computation-based problem solving, where I can effectively utilize my skills to solve real-world problems. I took multiple intrusive computer science courses in school and then, independently, I learned Python programming and gained a foundational understanding of data science and machine learning models. No matter how hard I tried to develop seemingly-perfect solutions, I was constantly discovering new and more creative ways to approach each task; at the core of my passion for Computer Science is the flexibility of deftly deploying creativity and programming a plethora of algorithms to solve a single problem.
